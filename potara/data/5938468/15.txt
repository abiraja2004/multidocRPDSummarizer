This might take a bit longer than expected.
I assumed that we had an existing inhouse test account that's both secure and has a super client dir.
After scanning most of our inhouse accounts, I can't find any that have both, so I filed an RPD to either be linked to one or to have one created.
I'll see how far I can get without an account.
