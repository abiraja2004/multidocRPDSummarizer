I think we should implement this as a specific whitelist.
I.e.
service X, Y, Z can post &gt; 50k if there is some specific reason.
There's no reason to just blanketly allow any existing account to post &gt;50k, especially if they have never posted a message larger than that before (this should be most accounts).
We should get this done with .5 it's been pushed back a couple of times already.
