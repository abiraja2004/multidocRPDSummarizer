Looking into this with Ed and Pavel.
The problem seems to be spreading to around fdsa.
fdsa7, fdsa8 is having the same hanging issue, but other nodes seems fine.
Checking pricing update scheule, and installed image versions to see if there is any dicrepencies here.
In cases that hangs, I'm getting a result back, before the image hangs.
