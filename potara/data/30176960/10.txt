Hi @RajulShrivastava We have been using the browser maximize logic in the script which maximizes the browser to the maximum available resolution of the machine.
As the node machine resolution is lesser than the expected, the browser also being maximized to the same resolution hence the test cases are failing.
I'll try to set the browser resolution to '1280x1024' though the code.
If that works we have to use this logic every time while launching the browser.
CC @LilunCao Thanks, Shiva
