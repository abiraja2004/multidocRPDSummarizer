@MichaelAltmaier - I have confirmed we can use FactSet Notify to email all the users.
@RyanClark - the attached spreadsheet has serial numbers and email addresses.
Is that enough for you to do a saved Target list so we can send a notification to these affected users.
When do we want to plan to send this?
Thanks!
