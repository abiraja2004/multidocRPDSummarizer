@RyanClark - were you able to get the target criteria list together from the new usage file @MarkSolis provided?
I believe we are talking about roughly 2,300 users?
@CristinaFlores - I think we should send an email first and then the following day, post within Notify.
Who is writing the email?
or has that been done already?
@MichaelAltmaier - let us know if you have any objections to a email going out today or tomorrow to all affected users for this change happening on the 26th.
Thanks!
