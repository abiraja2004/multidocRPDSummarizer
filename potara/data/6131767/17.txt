@AndrewKlajman @EricBlinn @JeroenRisseeuw @FreddyStrout @ChrisDudek Just wanted to see if there was ASV at risk by not having this as a default grouping/column?
We want to gauge the priority of this as we have much higher priority items that we are currently working on at the moment (e.g.
PA3/Projects, etc.).
Noting that you can use custom formulas (e.g.
PMWSM) to pull this information from an MSL.
Best Regards, Leslie
