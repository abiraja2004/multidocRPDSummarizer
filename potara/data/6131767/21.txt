Adding MAWER (who is on trial) that would like to have "Years to Expected Maturity" as a column and grouping in PA.
I used the code provided in Chris's comment above which worked for the portfolio; however, the client on trial uses DEX indices.
Would it be possible to add this for the DEX indices?
Thank you.
