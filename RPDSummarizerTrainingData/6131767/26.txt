@MarkSolis I support adding DS_EXPECTED_MATURITY as a Standard Calc.
It is a 'free calc' from ECS and is incredibly useful data.
I have made this request before in http://is.factset.com/rpd/Summary.aspx?messageId=22023187 .
@EricGrosspietsch Let's discuss in our catch up meeting tomorrow.
Thanks.
