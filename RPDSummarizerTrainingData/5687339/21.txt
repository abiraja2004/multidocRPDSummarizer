audsdeva01 is functional again.
I've deployed the auds server processes to a cassandra node which is a physical box with much more memory and disk space than the audsdev VM.
I'll continue doing this going forward until we have production hardware.
Tomorrow I'll recreate the client-side issue and look at failing faster in shadow mode.
@GregJordan please re-enable auds shadow mode on the test nodes.
