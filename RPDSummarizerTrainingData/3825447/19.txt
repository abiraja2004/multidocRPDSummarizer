This is a great conversation, hopefully we'll be able to populate a good library of solutions with this, that are easily found via search and views...
To add onto @MichelleLuft 's last point about "resolved per comments above"...
allowing users to resolve an RPD from within an existing comment they're currently typing would help encourage folks to think of their resolution as a "solution"...
and also reduce spam (since people doing the resolving are often clicking send twice): RPD:3759074
