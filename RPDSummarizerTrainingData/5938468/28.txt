Hi Everyone, Not sure if this was the intended result, but now whenever I morph in as a client, I'm unable to access the files in their Super Client directory.
What shows up instead are all of the files in the Super Client directory on our side.
The only way I've found to get around this is to morph in from the VMS command prompt.
Please let me know if I'm missing anything or if there is additional step that is now needed.
Thanks, Adam
