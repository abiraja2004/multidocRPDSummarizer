Hi Prasanna, I second Jason's comments with respect to SUPER_CLIENT.
I can't tell you the number of RPDs and frantic IMs I get from sales/support teams who are afraid their clients have lost IRN access because they're not familiar with secure SUPER_CLIENT directories and don't know to request access.
It's definitely a major point of confusion at the moment.
Thanks, Danielle
