A non-zero Priority seems like a valid priority, in the sense of run this, just last.
Maybe ScheduleType ("none") makes more sense?
The fact is that we want to test the scheduler on tellusdev, so having items schedule 'extra low' no matter what doesn't properly let us test the scheduler.
It would be nice to see jobs sent from Atlas vs Online vs other SWPs to all be slotted properly per: http://tellus/qadocs/Scheduling%20Automation%20workflow.htm But not executed.
