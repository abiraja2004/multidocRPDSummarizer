Thanks, @ChristopherElias , for you input.
@MichaelAltmaier and @MichaelGiordano -- Are you okay with posting the Notify message to the Portfolio Analysis Announcements list tomorrow then?
That will give users just over 2 weeks of notice.
Consultants can use the email template in my comment from 9-Jul, 9:37 a.m.
to contact any power PA users, in lieu of contacting all 2,000 individuals.
Thanks!
