last request here....can we get the name of the user next to the Serial Number column?
That will make it easier for the PA SPecialist and the COnsultant to know who to contact and who not to contact.
With just the serial number in the file, each one will need to be looked up.
With the name as well, it will save a significant amount of time.
Can we get this today?
