@MichaelAltmaier It looks like we're all set to send the internal product alert and the client message.
Do you have any objections or are we ok to send this on Thursday 5-Jul (assuming sending it tomorrow would make it get lost in the shuffle)?
This will give everyone 2 weeks notice.
Thanks, Bridie
