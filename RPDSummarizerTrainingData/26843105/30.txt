Also we realize that some of the RPD products are not auto assigned to Corporate Support Services - is this change also included in this release ?
Can you pls list out what all RPD products were included in this release which are not going to be auto assigned to CSS anymore ?
@CorporateSupportServices FYI Thanks KK
